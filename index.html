        <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
        <p>
            I'm glad you're here. You may not know me, but my name is Monica (my friends call me Mon and you
            can too if you'd like).

        <h2>A little more about who I am</h2> 
        <p>
            I live in Omaha, NE and I have 2 cats, Corby and Emma (I'll introduce you to them more later). 
            I love coffee, beer, rock climbing and enjoying the company of good friends and church family.
            I work at a construction company here in the Midwest - I answer phones and book appointments for
            folks who have foundation, basement, or concrete concerns. I love the company I work for and I hope
            I can stay in it for the long haul. However, I have recently decided answering phones all day isn't
            the way I'd like to spend the rest of my working life. I  have since embarked on a journey toward
            <strong>hopefully</strong> becoming a full-stack web developer. I have only been coding for a couple 
            months and so far, it has been the most challenging, frustrating and fun experience I've had in quite
            some time. Second to rock climbing. Thanks for joining me on this journey!

        <h3>Meet my fur-babes</h3>

        <p>
            Corby is my boy. He's the most complicated creature I've ever met. No one really likes him but everyone
            can't help but love him. He's much like a dog in the way that he behaves (he can fetch, he can
            walk on a leash) but he is about as needy as an infant. He's kind of the worst. 
            And I love him more than I love most people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emma is my girl and is also the youngest. She's fat. Like, obnoxiously fat. She has a little bit 
            of trouble saying no to that extra trip to the food bowl if you know what I mean. She's ever so 
            timid and gentle and loves to cuddle. Between you and me though, I definitely favor Corby over her.
            I know, I'm terrible.
